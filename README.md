AI-Powered Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard
Machine Learning Task-1 | Future Interns Internship

Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered retail sales forecasting dashboard to help businesses analyze historical sales data, predict future sales trends, and make informed business decisions. The dashboard combines machine learning techniques, data analysis, and interactive visualizations to deliver actionable insights for retail businesses.

The application allows users to explore sales trends, compare actual and forecasted values, analyze seasonal and holiday effects, and segment sales behavior using clustering techniques.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to clean and preprocess retail sales data, perform feature engineering on time-based variables, apply forecasting and clustering techniques, and present insights through an interactive dashboard.

Key Features
The dashboard provides sales forecasting with actual versus predicted sales trends, monthly and yearly sales comparisons, and interactive time-series visualizations.
It includes sales clustering to segment sales behavior and allows users to filter data based on clusters.
Holiday impact analysis is implemented to highlight sales spikes during major Indian festivals and national holidays.
Key performance indicators such as total sales, average sales, maximum sales, minimum sales, and holiday sales are displayed and dynamically updated.

Technologies Used
Python is used for data processing and machine learning workflows.
Pandas and NumPy are used for data cleaning and feature engineering.
Plotly is used for interactive data visualizations.
Streamlit is used to build and deploy the interactive dashboard.
The dataset used is a retail sales forecasting dataset from Kaggle.

Project Structure
The repository contains the main application file app.py, a requirements.txt file listing dependencies, CSV files for sales forecasting and clustered sales data, and this README file.

Dataset Description
The sales_forecast_dashboard.csv file contains forecasted sales values generated using time-series models.
The monthly_sales_clusters.csv file contains historical sales data along with pricing, stock levels, date-based features, and cluster labels.

How to Run the Project
Install the required dependencies using pip.
Run the Streamlit application using the command streamlit run app.py.
The dashboard will open in a web browser.

Deployment
The application is deployed using Streamlit Cloud, providing a permanent and publicly accessible dashboard link.

Business Insights
This dashboard helps identify high-performing months and low-demand seasons, analyze the impact of pricing and stock on sales, measure the effect of holidays on sales performance, and support cluster-based decision-making for inventory and marketing strategies.

Internship Context
This project was completed as part of Machine Learning Task-1 under the Future Interns Internship Program. It demonstrates practical application of machine learning, data analytics, and dashboard deployment skills.
